WIP Spotify Web Player with bells, whistles and GL shaders.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the Cordless2 in the development mode.<br>

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
